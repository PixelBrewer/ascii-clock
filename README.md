A simple digital clock using ascii art

## Idea

The idea to create a perpetual clock using ascii art in the terminal came from my need to have a clock on a second monitor while gaming. I game on Pop!\_OS and unfortunately, the clock on the top bar is not always visible. I wanted to have a clock that would be visible at all times, even when I am in fullscreen mode.

## To run the app simply run the following command in your terminal:

python3 main.py

## Requirements

- Python 3

## Ideas

One enhancment idea that I have is to color code the AM/PM cycle.
